            <h2>Goal of Project</h2>
            <p>The objective of this project is to create a solar-powered charging dock for scooters on campus. This will be for both personal and enterprise scooters as well as other chargable transportation vehicles, provided the charging type is available.</p>

            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p>Industries have implemented their own scooters on various campuses to provide a marketable method of transportation. This is a good thing as it provides students a means to get around campus; however, the following problems have been encountered:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>They appear everywhere, <em>even places where they are inconvenient</em>.</li>
                <li>They require manpower to fetch and recharge.</li>
                <li>Have to be charged using local power</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>juicers use power from their own homes and this potentially uses non-renewable energy</em></li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <p>The following solutions will be targets of this project.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Charge from solar grid, not local homes.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>guarantees use of clean, renewable energry.</em></li>
                </ul>
                <li>Provide certain points on campus where scooters can be parked and found.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Progress</h2>
            <p>Most of what has been completed has been in the planning stage. As of Nov. 5, equipment has been tested and a general idea has been developed as of what direction the project is going in.</p>
