                    <img src="images/limeScooter.jpg" style="width: 600px;">
                    <p> The objective of this project is to create a solar-powered charging dock for scooters on campus. This will be for both personal and enterprise scooters and potentially other chargeable vehicles, provided the charging type is available.</p>
                    <p>Industries have implemented their own scooters on various campuses to provide a marketable method of transportation. This is a good thing as it provides students a means to get around campus; however, these scooters are often left in inconvenient places, require people to fetch them and deliver them to designated spaces for people to find them, and they are often charged using a <i>juicer's</i> home power, which often uses non-renewable energy.</p>
                    <p>This project is not affiliated with Lime, but their scooters are expected to be a common target of this project.</p>
